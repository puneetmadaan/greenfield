## About
A very minimal implementation of the Greenfield compositor-module library. Demonstrates how to setup and interact with the Greenfield compositor module.

## Usage

- `yarn install`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn start`

To run the remote GTK3 application, first make sure to follow the instructions in the [environments/local](https://github.com/udevbe/greenfield/tree/master/environments/local) directory at the root of this repository.
Alternatively you can run [app-endpoint-server](https://github.com/udevbe/greenfield/tree/master/app-endpoint-server) directly without docker.
